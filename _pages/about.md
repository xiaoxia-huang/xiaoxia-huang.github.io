Welcome! Iâ€™m Xiaoxia Huang, a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Political Science](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/academics/political-science-department) at [Syracuse University](https://www.syracuse.edu/). My research focuses on gender and bureaucracy in China.

My dissertation examines bureaucratic recruitment in China, focusing on how merit-based recruitment has improved gender representation in the civil service, the resulting backlash, and its broader consequences. My other ongoing projects explore the allocation of public sector jobs in China, gendered patterns in bureaucratic promotions, and the role of gender in the Chinese legislature. My dissertation has been supported by the [Empirical Study of Gender Research Network (EGEN)](http://www.egenpolisci.org/) and the [Carrie Chapman Catt Prize](https://cattcenter.iastate.edu/research/catt-prize/).

Outside of my academic work, I enjoy cooking and hiking, and I hike weekly.

For more information, please see my [CV(PDF)](/assets/pdf/xiaoxia_huang_cv.pdf).
